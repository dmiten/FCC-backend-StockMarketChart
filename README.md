## Chart the Stock Market
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
[this]( http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com).
 Then deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch 
project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit 
[this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
 - I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
 - I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
 - I can remove stocks.
 - I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
